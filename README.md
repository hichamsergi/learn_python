# WHAT I LEARNED?

The porpouse of this README is keeping a record of every key concept I learned in order to solve the coding challenges.

### Chapter 1

* **01_List comprehension**:

    The purpose of this challenge was create a matrix of 3 cordenades, [_x_,_y_,_z_], excluding the cordenades that sum a given number _n_.

    What I learned here is the capability of _list comprehension_, and how useful it is in order to generate matrixes of _n_ cordenades, including conditional sintaxes. Example:

```
    list = [[i, j, k] for i in range(x+1) for j in range(y+1) for k in range(z+1) if (i + j + k) != n]
```
* **02_RunnerUp score**:
* **03_Nested lists**:
* **04_Finding percentages**:
* **05_Lists commands**:
* **06_Tuples**:
